  Eleven Drums is a therapeputic drumming provider created and led by a former co-worker, Von. 
  I was commissioned to create this website for her business, which was a wonderful learning opportunity for me. 

  In creating this project, I learned valuable skills including: 
  <ul>

    <li>Creating practical 
    <li>Working with a custom domain name provider, GoDaddy</li>
    <li>Hosting a website using this custom domain using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></li>
    <li>Working and communicating with a client regarding the vision for their website, and helping to realise this vision</li>
    <li>General business operations of a freelance web developer, including producing formal agreements, contracts, and tax invoices</li>
  </ul>
